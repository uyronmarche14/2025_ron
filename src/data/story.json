I always told myself that a career is more important than a relationship. I wanted to set myself up for a better future, and it all worked out well. However, I forgot the most crucial part—losing the people who were closest to me. In the process, I also lost the one thing I valued most. The heights aren't always what we should aim for, but I hope we can reach them without losing ourselves.",
